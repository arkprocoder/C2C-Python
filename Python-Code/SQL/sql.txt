Question 1:
You are managing a Products table with the following columns: ProductID, ProductName, and Price. The ProductID is the primary key, and each product must have a unique identifier. Insert a new record for a product with the following details:

ProductID: 3
ProductName: "Tablet"
Price: 12000.50
Also, write a query to display all the products with a price greater than 15000.


Question 2:
You have a table called Orders with the following columns: OrderID, Quantity, and Price. The table has a constraint that ensures the Quantity must be greater than 0, and Price must be 0 or higher. Write an SQL query to insert an order with:

OrderID: 5
Quantity: 7
Price: 350.75
Additionally, write a query to find all orders where Quantity is more than 5 and the Price is less than 300.

Question 3:
You have a BusinessUsers table where the following columns exist: UserID, Username, Email, and Password. The table enforces the following rules:

Username and Email should be unique.
Username and Email cannot be NULL.
Write a query to insert a new business user with the following details:

UserID: 3
Username: "john"
Email: "john@gmail.com"
Password: "john1234"
Write an additional query to update the password for the user whose Username is "john" to "newpass2024".

Question 4
You are tasked with creating two tables: Customers and Orders. The Customers table will store information about the customers, and the Orders table will store details of the orders placed by these customers. There is a relationship between the two tables, where each order is associated with one customer.

Write the SQL query to create the Customers table with the following columns:

CustomerID (Primary Key)
CustomerName (NOT NULL)
Write the SQL query to create the Orders table with the following columns:

OrderID (Primary Key)
OrderDate (NOT NULL)
CustomerID (Foreign Key referencing the Customers table)
Insert the following data into the Customers table:

CustomerID: 1, CustomerName: "Alice"
CustomerID: 2, CustomerName: "Bob"
Insert the following data into the Orders table:

OrderID: 101, OrderDate: '2024-10-01', CustomerID: 1
OrderID: 102, OrderDate: '2024-10-02', CustomerID: 2
